    # Specify the time during which you expect the least traffic.
    # NO DEFAULT value. Mandatory attribute.
    # ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi is the format for time window. (24H Clock UTC)

    # The security group configured for pre-created bastion host.

    # Mandatory
    # Threshold value is used for triggering alarms.
    # If the Freeable memory value goes beyond the threshold for a period of five minutes,
    # alarm will be triggered and email will be send to the "alerts/email" specified in service_spec.yml
    # NO DEFAULT value. The value should be calculated based on the CacheNodeType chosen.
    freeable_memory_threshold: 1000000
    # Mandatory
